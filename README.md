# World Robot Summit 2025 Harsh Environment F-REI Challenge, Simulation Disaster Challenge Official GitHub

## Overview
The competition at the tournament is set up with the scenario of “Information gathering and emergency response in a harsh environment, assuming a plant disaster".

## Task（Regularly update）
- We currently have built a simulation environment that takes into account the tasks required for disaster response.
- We have uploaded a simplified course that will allow you to perform each task in the future.

## New information（Update: August 29th, 2025）
- The simulation environment consisted of four areas, Area 1 to Area 4, as shown below. The competition was divided into each area.

#### Area 1: Lever control, Turning on the light, Opening the door

##### Scenario
You use a remote-controlled robot to explore an area where objects are scattered after a plant accident. Since the area is dark, the robot can turn on lights by operating switches to illuminate the area. It will open doors and explore small rooms. To explore the area, the robot must read as many QR codes scattered throughout the area as possible and return to the starting point within the time limit. This area is designed to measure the robot's mobility, operability, and exploration capabilities. Additionally, it is necessary to consider the possibility of limited visibility due to communication issues caused by remote operation, as well as the possibility of sudden power outages.

#### Area 2: Firefighting

##### Scenario
You must explore this area where objects are scattered after a plant disaster. Since there is a fire in this area, the robots take out a fire hose from the fire extinguisher box and put out the fire. Gases (smoke) and liquids (water) leak from pipes in the area, so the robot can stop the leaking fluids by operating the valves. It is also necessary to read the values of the analog meters installed in the plant.To explore this area, the robot must read as many QR codes scattered throughout the area as possible and return to the starting point within the time limit. This area is constructed to measure the movement, manipulation, and search abilities of the robots. In addition, it is necessary to assume that the field of vision will be reduced due to the effects of communication in remote control and that there may be sudden power outages.

#### Area 3: Running up/down stairs and slope

##### Scenario
You must explore this area where objects are scattered after a plant disaster.
Gases (smoke) and liquids (water) leak from pipes in the area, so the robot can stop the leaking fluids by operating the valves. 
The robots must climb the stairs or ramp, turn the valve on the second floor, and stop the leak.
It is also necessary to read the values of the analog meters installed in the plant. To explore this area, the robot must read as many QR codes scattered throughout the area as possible and return to the starting point within the time limit. This area is constructed to measure the movement, manipulation, and search abilities of the robots. In addition, it is necessary to assume that the field of vision will be reduced due to the effects of communication in remote control and that there may be sudden power outages.

#### Area 4: Entering ducts, tank inspections

##### Scenario
You use the robot, which is UAV, to enter the duct and investigate the tank connected to the duct. The passage connected to the duct is narrow and maze-like, requiring careful exploration to avoid getting lost. On the other hand, Gases (smoke) and liquids (water) leak from pipes in the area, so the UGV can stop the leaking fluids by operating the valves. In order to explore the area, you must read as many QR codes as possible, which are scattered around the area, and move the robot from the start area to the goal area within the time limit. This area is constructed to measure the movement, manipulation and search abilities of the robots. In addition, it is necessary to assume that the field of vision will be reduced due to the effects of communication in remote control, and that there may be sudden power outages.

- As part of the harsh environment challenge, the following video communication noise occasionally occurs. Please operate the robot so that it functions properly, even in the presence of noise.

## Important Notice（Update: August 29th, 2025）
- Robot simulation will be performed on computers provided by the organizers
	- The specs of the organizer's computer: https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0BTM9SYSX?language=en_US

- Please obtain the simulation results via network communication and operate the robots on your own computers. The computers provided by the organizers will serve as servers, and the computers provided by the competitors will serve as clients.
	- The mobile robot is in a simulation on the organizer's computers and connected to the competitor's computers via the network. This relationship is similar to a real mobile robot connected to a host computers via a network. If a team wishes to use its unique robot or functions in the match, it will submit the robot model and program to the organizers, who will implement it on the competition simulation computers.
